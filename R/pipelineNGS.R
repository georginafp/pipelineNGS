#' Pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing Experiments
#' 
#' This package provides an R implementation to several tools and scripts for NGS alignment and post-processing.
#' 
#' PipelineNGS is designed to facilitate the implementation of a full NGS pipeline and downstream analysis in R. It contains several wrapper functions, where arguments are passed to the command line-tools and processes are therefore run as if it were in the terminal.
